									CDC libusb	Vs	USB VCP Zero len packet 
										(For communication)


The choice between using the CDC (Communication Device Class) via libusb and the USB VCP (Virtual Communication Port) 
with Zero Packet Length approach depends on specific requirements and use cases. 
Both approaches have their advantages and limitations, and the optimal choice may vary depending on the application 
and system constraints.


CDC via libusb:

Flexibility: 
CDC is a standard USB class that provides a more generic communication interface. 
It is not limited to a specific type of communication and can be used for various purposes, 
such as serial communication, networking, or custom protocols.

	Libusb: Using libusb allows for more direct and low-level control over USB communication. 
	It is a library that enables applications to communicate with USB devices without the need for specific drivers.


#### USB VCP with Zero Packet Length:

Simplicity: 
The USB VCP approach with Zero Packet Length is often associated with virtual COM ports, 
making it more straightforward for serial communication. 
This can be advantageous when the primary goal is to establish a simple, standard serial link between devices.

	Ease of Use: Virtual COM ports are widely supported by operating systems, and many applications are designed to work 
	seamlessly with COM ports. This can simplify the integration process for certain applications.


#### Choosing between these approaches depends on factors such as:

Application Requirements: 
If the application requires a more generic communication interface or involves non-standard protocols, 
CDC via libusb might be a better fit.

	System Constraints: Consider the resources available on the target system. If there are limitations in terms of processing power, memory, or available libraries, one approach might be more suitable than the other.

	Ease of Integration: If simplicity and ease of integration are critical, the USB VCP approach with Zero Packet Length may be preferred, especially if the application primarily involves serial communication.

	Operating System Support: Ensure that the chosen approach is well-supported across the target operating systems. Some platforms may have better support for specific USB classes or libraries.


######
There is no one-size-fits-all answer, and the choice between CDC via libusb and USB VCP with Zero Packet Length depends on 
the specific requirements and constraints of the given project. 
It's important to carefully evaluate the pros and cons of each approach in the context of the intended application.

					##### Comparison for CDC libusb 	and 	USB VCP Zero len Packet	#######


CDC via libusb:
Advantages:

Flexibility: 
CDC is a versatile USB class that can support various types of communication protocols, not limited to serial communication. 
This flexibility makes it suitable for a wide range of applications.

Libusb Control: 
libusb provides low-level control over USB communication, allowing developers to have direct access to USB features 
without relying on platform-specific drivers.

Platform Independence: 
Since libusb is a cross-platform library, applications developed using CDC and libusb can run on different operating systems 
without major modifications.

Custom Protocols: 
CDC can be used to implement custom communication protocols, making it suitable for applications with specific requirements 
beyond standard serial communication.




Disadvantages:

Complexity: 
Working with libusb can be more complex than using higher-level APIs or virtual COM ports. 
Developers need to handle lower-level USB communication details, which may be challenging for beginners.

Driver Development: 
While libusb eliminates the need for platform-specific drivers, developers may still need to implement custom drivers 
for some operating systems.

USB VCP with Zero Packet Length:
Advantages:

Simplicity: 
USB VCP, especially when used as a virtual COM port with Zero Packet Length, 
provides a simple and standardized way for serial communication. It is widely supported by operating systems and applications.

Ease of Integration: 
Virtual COM ports are recognized by many applications that work with serial communication, simplifying the integration process.

Operating System Support: 
USB VCP is well-supported by default drivers in most operating systems, reducing the need for custom driver development.

Serial Communication Focus: 
If the primary requirement is serial communication, USB VCP with Zero Packet Length provides a straightforward solution 
without the need for extensive protocol handling.



Disadvantages:

Limited to Serial Communication: 
USB VCP is primarily designed for serial communication. 
If the application requires a different type of communication or custom protocols, it may not be the most suitable choice.

Less Flexibility: 
USB VCP may not be as flexible as CDC in handling diverse communication requirements.

Dependence on COM Port: 
Some systems may have limitations or conflicts related to the availability of COM ports, 
potentially causing issues in certain environments.
