Q: What have you done in your project ? 
---- Our "INTRO" to the Project -----

 - Project Title : Prototyping a Linux USB device Driver using a Microcontroller configured USB deivce.
 	Our Project Involves 4 stages of overall and those can be sperately refered as :

	1. The Client Side : We have configured a microcontroler as an USB device with our specific identifications 
						 and provided periferal functionalities.
	
	2. The Host Side   : We have provided a usb driver module 
						 which is to be inserted to the kernel in a .ko ie. kernel module file format.
						 compiled form an .c src file.

	3. The Test Case   : we have implemented a Luminance Responsive functionality over our USB device 
						 to demonstrate the "driver - device" interactions rather associative connectivity
						 which reflect in the kerner msg logs

	4. The Make file   : The file containing the instructions to build the .ko modules form the targeted .c src file
							
							- Extra_info : Make-file 
											A GNU standard which is a UNIX utility provided for automated compilation 
											of heavy files like .ko modules, Kernel srcs, and even softwares.
